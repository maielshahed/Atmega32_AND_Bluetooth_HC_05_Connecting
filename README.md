Controlling the car via Bluetooth and Atmega32

Description: 
A moving robot, the robot has the ability to navigate in the surrounding environment, and is controlled by Bluetooth HC-05, and is designed with simple techniques such as using pulse width modulation (PWM) to control the speed of the motor, and using Motor Driver IC L293D to control the movement of the motor and directions.
Achieved Two MCUs communicate with each other through UART Protocol the first MCU receives and displays the data from the user, while the second decides the action.

Drivers: (Bluetooth HC-05,GPIO,Motor Driver IC L293D , Timer, UART, and DC-Motor)

Microcontroller: ATmega32 .
